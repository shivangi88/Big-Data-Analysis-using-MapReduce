"5902"	"@frolferguy420 @davidgoodner You're right, insurance companies are one reason we have enormous health care costs, and some efficiencies could be realized by eliminating them.

"5904"	"@frolferguy420 @davidgoodner All the literature I have seen showing reduced health care spending under M4A assumes current Medicare payment rates, which are substantially lower than private insurance payments.
